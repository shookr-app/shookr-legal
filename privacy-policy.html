        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

        <p>Devin Dhaliwal ("we," "our," or "us") built Shookr as a gratitude journal application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Shookr is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Your first name, entered during onboarding, used only to personalize your experience within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Your gratitude entries, wins, and thorns that you write in the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your reminder settings and app preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p><strong>All of your data is stored locally on your device.</strong> We do not transmit, upload, or sync your journal entries or personal information to any server or cloud service. Your data never leaves your device.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect analytics or usage data.</li>
            <li>We do not use tracking technologies or advertising identifiers.</li>
            <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
            <li>We do not collect photos or media.</li>
            <li>We do not collect device identifiers for tracking purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Shookr does not share your data with any third-party services. If you purchase a subscription, payment processing is handled entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). We do not receive or store your payment information.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Shookr offers optional subscription plans. All payments and subscription management are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about how they handle payment data.</p>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>If you enable daily reminders, the app uses your device's local notification system. No notification data is sent to external servers. You can disable notifications at any time through the app or your device settings.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all of your data at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in your profile settings. Since all data is stored locally, deleting the app will also remove all associated data. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Shookr is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
