        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

        <p>Devin Dhaliwal ("we," "our," or "us") built Shookr as a gratitude journal application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our app.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Shookr is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Name:</strong> Your first name, entered during onboarding, used only to personalize your experience within the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Journal Entries:</strong> Your gratitude entries, wins, and thorns that you write in the app. These are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your reminder settings and app preferences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analytics and Telemetry</h2>
        <p>To improve the app experience, we collect anonymized usage data. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Screen views, feature interactions, button taps, and session duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, app version, and screen resolution.</li>
            <li><strong>Crash Reports:</strong> Error logs, stack traces, and device state at the time of a crash to help us identify and fix bugs.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Data:</strong> App launch time, response times, and general performance metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is collected in aggregate and <strong>does not include your journal entries, name, or any personal content you create in the app</strong>. Analytics data is processed by third-party analytics services and is used solely to improve app stability and user experience.</p>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p><strong>Your personal content (journal entries, name, and preferences) is stored locally on your device.</strong> We do not transmit, upload, or sync your journal entries or personal information to any server or cloud service.</p>
        <p>Anonymized analytics and crash data may be transmitted to our third-party analytics providers. This data cannot be used to identify you personally.</p>

        <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect or transmit your journal entries.</li>
            <li>We do not use advertising identifiers or serve ads.</li>
            <li>We do not collect location data.</li>
            <li>We do not collect photos or media.</li>
            <li>We do not sell or share your data with advertisers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use third-party services to help us operate and improve the app:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Superwall:</strong> We use Superwall to manage in-app subscriptions and paywalls. Superwall may collect device information, app usage data, and subscription-related events to help us optimize the user experience. For more information, see <a href="https://superwall.com/privacy" target="_blank">Superwall's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics Provider:</strong> To collect anonymized usage and crash data as described above. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only on our behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> If you purchase a subscription, payment is handled entirely by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play). We do not receive or store your payment information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Shookr offers optional subscription plans. All payments and subscription management are processed through Apple's App Store or Google Play Store. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for information about how they handle payment data.</p>

        <h2>Notifications</h2>
        <p>If you enable daily reminders, the app uses your device's local notification system. No notification data is sent to external servers. You can disable notifications at any time through the app or your device settings.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all of your data at any time using the "Clear All Data" option in your profile settings. Since all data is stored locally, deleting the app will also remove all associated data. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Shookr is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
